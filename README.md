# Box-Isolation
Sometimes I need to extract information from screenshots of excel sheets (numbers or pictures)
This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect boxes present in a picture by identifying vertical and horizontal lines, and isolating the content inside
A number/letter recognition program will be added later to filter out the usable information so i can put them into an actual excel sheet
